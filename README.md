Face Recognition Attendance System
📌 Overview
A desktop-based Face Recognition Attendance System built with Python, OpenCV (Haar Cascade), and PyQt5. This application detects and recognizes faces in real-time, logs attendance, and provides a user-friendly interface for managing users, cameras, and subscriptions.

✨ Key Features
✅ Real-time Face Detection & Recognition
✅ Attendance Logging (CSV)
✅ User Management (Add/Delete Users)
✅ Camera Management (IP/Webcam Support)
✅ Unknown Face Capture & Logging
✅ Admin Dashboard with UI/UX
✅ Subscription & License Key Validation
✅ Crash-Resistant & Optimized

🎯 Usage
1. Login Screen
Default Admin Credentials:

Username: admin

Password: admin123

2. Dashboard
Live Camera Feed: Displays real-time face detection.

Left Panel:

Add Known Person: Upload or capture images.

Users: View/Delete registered users.

License: Validate subscription key.

Right Panel:

Logs: Displays unknown faces and errors.

3. Adding a User
Click "Add Known Person".

Choose:

Upload Images (from PC)

Capture Images (via webcam)

Enter user name and save.

4. Attendance Logging
Detected faces are logged in attendance.csv with:

Date

Name

Camera Position

In/Out Time

5. Handling Unknown Faces
Unknown faces are saved in unknown_faces/ with timestamps.

Admins can later label and retrain the model.

🔒 Subscription & Licensing
License Key: Required for premium features.

Default Key: MY-VALID-KEY (for testing).

Admin Panel:

Add/Update license keys.

Restrict features based on subscription.

📝 Notes
Haar Cascade vs. DNN:

This app uses Haar Cascade (lightweight but less accurate).

For better accuracy, consider DNN-based models (e.g., face_recognition library).

Performance: Optimized for low-end PCs.

Extensibility: Built with Factory Design Pattern for modularity.
